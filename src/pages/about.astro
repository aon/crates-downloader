    <h1>ðŸ¦€ Crates Downloader</h1>

    <h2>Why?</h2>
    <p>
      This website is made to make easy downloading some crates that don't have
      a published repository.
    </p>

    <h2>How does it work?</h2>
    <p>
      In order to use it, you just have to paste your <u>docs.rs</u> or <u
        >crates.io</u
      > url. Something like this: <a href="https://docs.rs/tokio/1.23.0/tokio"
        >https://docs.rs/tokio/1.23.0/tokio</a
      >. Or this: <a href="https://crates.io/crates/tokio"
        >https://crates.io/crates/tokio</a
      >.
    </p>
    <p>
      First, it checks the version in the URL. In the case of the first url,
      it'll just download the version <mark>1.23.0</mark>. In the second case,
      or if the version is <mark>latest</mark>, it'll get the latest published
      version using the <a href="https://crates.io/api/v1/crates"
        >crates.io API</a
      >.
    </p>
    <p>Finally, it redirects you to the official download page.</p>

    <h2>The downloaded file has a .crate extension... what?</h2>
    <p>It is a <i>.tar.gz</i>. Just rename it.</p>
